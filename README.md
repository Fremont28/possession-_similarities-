# possession-_similarities-
Grouping 2015-16 NBA teams based on shot attempt and possession metrics 

We created three clusters (Kmeans) to examine the similarties and differences between 30 NBA teamsâ€™ shot patterns based on ~50,000 unique possesions that resulted in a shot from the 2015-2016 season. 

The variables used for clustering were the distance of the shot, type of shot, possession time, and whether the shot was assisted or blocked.
